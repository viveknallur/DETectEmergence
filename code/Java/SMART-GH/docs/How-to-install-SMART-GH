# SMART-GH Route Planner

SMART-GH extends graphhopper (https://graphhopper.com/) ,which is a fast and memory efficient Java road routing engine released under Apache License 2.0, with a smart and personalized dimension. 
SMART-GH integrates real time data captured from sensors, utilizing citizens as sensors, and enables the user to submit smart and personalized routing requests:

	- Transport mode: car, foot, bike, mtb and racing bike.
	- Quality of route: fastest, shortest, least noisy, least air polluted, least polluted (combination of sensors).

GraphHopper is tuned towards road networks with OpenStreetMap data but can be useful for public transport problems as well.

SMART-GH Pre-requisites:
-----------------------
 
 * SMART-GH is built using Maven, so you need to have Maven and Java installed and configured on your computer (http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
 * SMART-GH uses Redis to store and maintain sensors data, so you need to have Redis running:
	- Linux: (http://redis.io/download)
	- Windows: One click Redis install as a Windows service(https://github.com/rgl/redis/downloads)
 * Windows user must install Cygwin: https://www.cygwin.com/
 * Sensor data: To download, reverse-geocode and transform sensor data into a format usable by SMART-GH, python is required. Any version >2.6 will do (but not version 3). 
   Having installed python, install the required libraries using the `pip' command. 
	- (sudo, if required) pip install -r requirements.txt
	- Windows: 
			  - download get-pip.py from:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows
			  - Run "python get-pip.py"
			  - Run "C:\PythonXX\Tools\Scripts\win_add2path.py"
			  - Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
		
Get Started with SMART-GH
-------------------------

 1. Clone SMART-GH: https://github.com/DIVERSIFY-project/SMART-GH.git
 2. Copy dublin-m50.osm map (https://www.dropbox.com/s/ozo6nowib7dcfbj/dublin-m50.osm?dl=0) to SMART-GH/maps
	- For sensor-based routing to work correctly, all maps should be placed in maps folder, and should be named following this naming convention: city-*.osm; e.g.,paris-centre.osm
 3. Make sure that 'config.properties' file exists inside SMART-GH folder, and that it satisfies these settings: https://www.dropbox.com/s/bsnkxc3vtgax0tf/config.properties?dl=0
 4. Run Sensor parsing Daemon:
	- Go to SMART-GH/sensor_processing
	- run "python process_sensor_data_daemon.py"
 5. Run "mvn -DskipTests package" (use Cygwin if you are using Windows)
 6. Run "./graphhopper.sh web ./maps/dublin-m50.osm" (use Cygwin if you are using Windows)
