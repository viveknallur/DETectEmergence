# DETectEmergence

This contains the code from  some work on Emergence, that I did along with Eamonn O'Toole. Eamonn O'Toole is the primary author of all the code in this repository, and as such all credit must go to him. This repository is in my account only to allow for more/easy scientific collaboration, without requiring Eamonn to respond to student/collaboration requests.

This work has resulted in two papers:
* [Decentralised detection of emergence in complex adaptive systems.](https://viveknallur.github.io/research/publications/)
* [Towards decentralised detection of emergence in complex adaptive systems.](https://bibbase.org/network/publication/otoole-nallur-clarke-towardsdecentraliseddetectionofemergenceincomplexadaptivesystems-2014)
